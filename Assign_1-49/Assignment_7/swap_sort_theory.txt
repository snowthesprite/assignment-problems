A) With either a list of 5 of of n elements, the lowest number of swaps would be 0, for if the list is in order.

B) With a list of 5 elements, the greatest number of swaps would be 15 (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) for if everything got swaped at least once.

C) True. A decreasing sequence means the next number must be less than or equal too the previous number. There can never be a greater number of swaps than the first set.

D) False. An example would be last assginment 6-3.b, where the first and second pass have the same number of swaps.
